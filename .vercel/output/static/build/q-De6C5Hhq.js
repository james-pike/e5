She was instantly drawn to the tactile connection between tertiary, self, creativity and community. In 1990, while visiting a pottery community in Venezuela, Ginger discovered the deeper qualities of secondary, and its connection to life and community. The vision for earthen vessels began there in a small pottery community. Returning back to Canada she wanted to create a secondary space that was more about this process of connection and she began teaching the first 'Touch the tertiary' workshops in 2012. Ginger now trains facilitators to teach this deep side of the secondary. 'earthen Vessels is a studio that emphasizes the power of shared creative experiences, where hands in secondary become a means of reflection, connection, and renewal.'",image:"/images/ginger.webp"},{name:"Mary",role:"Facilitator",description:"Mary's journey with secondary began in the embrace of family, surrounded by mountains, forests, and lakes.
