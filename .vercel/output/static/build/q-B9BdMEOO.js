The workshop focused on mindfulness and how we can metaphorically present ourselves through creating a pottery bowl. The atmosphere was incredibly relaxing, and the instructor provided clear and thoughtful guidance, making it easy to focus on the process rather than just the outcome. As someone with prior experience working with clay, I found this workshop especially soothing because it allowed me to step away from perfectionism and truly enjoy the act of creating. Surprisingly, the final bowl turned out beautifully, but what stayed with me most was the sense of calm and presence I felt during those three hours. I highly recommend earthen vessels to anyone looking for a mindful, hands-on experience with clay. Whether you’re a beginner or have experience, this workshop will leave you feeling refreshed and inspired!",rating:5,date:"2025-07-20T13:00:00Z",role:"Experienced Potter"},{id:4,name:"Laura",review:"I can't say enough about the ‘Open Like a Bowl’ workshop at earthen vessels.

The workshop really opened my creative channels and left me with a feeling of peace and restoration that lingered long after, I walked out the door.
