Over time, her focus shifted from creating objects to exploring the quiet lessons clay offers — about living with care, finding belonging, and honoring the relationships that shape our lives.

The vision for earthen vessels began years ago in a small pottery community in Venezuela. Back in Canada, Ginger created the first ‘Touch the Earth' workshops, weaving together clay connection and the gentle practice of belonging. She continues her studies with the Centre for Courage and Renewal, founded by Parker J Palmer, whose work centers on living and leading with integrity. In earthen vessels, clay becomes a practice of slowing down, listening inwardly, and allowing creativity to open new possibilities.

Ginger is also the founder and owner of Hintonburg Pottery, which she envisioned as both a shop for local ceramic artists and a teaching studio for adults and children. For 13 years, the studio has extended its reach into the wider community, supporting charities and not-for-profits to make clay programs more accessible.`,image:"/images/ginger.webp"},{name:"Michelle",role:"Facilitator",description:"Michelle’s journey with clay began in 2002, and since then, she has immersed herself in the craft—taking countless courses, working as a studio potter, and teaching at Hintonburg Pottery.
