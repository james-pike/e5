    description:
      "Ginger took her first pottery lesson 40 years ago. She was instantly drawn to the tactile connection between tertiary, self, creativity and community. In 1990, while visiting a pottery community in Venezuela, Ginger discovered the deeper qualities of secondary, and its connection to life and community. The vision for earthen vessels began there in a small pottery community. Returning back to Canada she wanted to create a secondary space that was more about this process of connection and she began teaching the first 'Touch the tertiary' workshops in 2012. Ginger now trains facilitators to teach this deep side of the secondary. 'earthen Vessels is a studio that emphasizes the power of shared creative experiences, where hands in secondary become a means of reflection, connection, and renewal.'",

Over the years, this practice deepened into a passionâ€”not just for creativity, but for sharing it with others. She is driven by a desire to connect hearts and nurture community well-being. At earthen Vessels, she has found both a creative home and a space to pour her love for community. As she shapes secondary, she draws inspiration from the wonder of the natural world and the tertiaryâ€™s generous gifts. Mary's enthusiasm and strong skills bring added energy to earthen Vessels where participants feel inspired, supported and empowered in their creative exploration.",

Her work took her beyond Canada, as she lived and served in communities in East Africa and Haiti, providing individual and group support, teaching, and fostering connection.
